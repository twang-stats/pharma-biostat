Side projects on biostatistics &amp; pharmaceutical statistics

Before committing to statistics full-time, I used to work in pharmaceutical contract research, with a particular specialization in veterinary medicine. During my time at that position, I learned a lot about how regulatory agencies view statistics, and I increasingly felt that there is a lot of untapped potential for new methods here.

The purpose of this repository is to hold my random ideas and musings about biostatistics in general, particularly things that I feel can fill the gap between the practices I saw in contract research and modern statistical methods. Currently I am thinking of:

1. Analyzing Serious Adverse Events reported to the FDA using R. Some attempts were made towards data cleaning in R, but the .json files from the FDA do not exactly translate nicely into tables in R. Current plan is to figure out an alternate means of extracting and flattening the information in SQL.
