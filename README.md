Side projects on biostatistics &amp; pharmaceutical statistics

Before committing to statistics full-time, I used to work in pharmaceutical contract research, with a particular specialization in veterinary medicine. During my time at that position, I learned a lot about how regulatory agencies view statistics, and I increasingly felt that there is a lot of untapped potential for new methods here.

The purpose of this repository is to hold my random ideas and musings about biostatistics in general, particularly things that I feel can fill the gap between the practices I saw in contract research and modern statistical methods.
